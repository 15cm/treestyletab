And, WebExtensions-based renewed version is in development in now,
and it will be released for Firefox 57. See also:
https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/issues/1224#issuecomment-326467198

XUL-based legacy version won't work on Firefox 57, and

To concentrate to development of the WE-based version,
please don't open issues about feature requests or trivial bug reports
about the XUL-based version.
