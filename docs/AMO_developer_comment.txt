## Public API for other addons

For addon authors, Tree Style Tab provides public API. If your addon provides extra context menu items for context menu on tabs, you can easily support TST's context menu with small changes. For more details, see the <a href="https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/API-for-other-addons">API document</a>.
